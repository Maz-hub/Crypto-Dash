# 💰 Crypto Pricing Dashboard

A React project built to learn how to work with APIs in real time.  
This dashboard will display cryptocurrency prices, market caps, and trading volumes using live data from the **CoinGecko API** (demo tier, free).

## 🧩 Goal

To practice:
- Making API requests in React using `useEffect`
- Handling async data (loading, error, and success states)
- Displaying dynamic data from a public API in a responsive UI

## ⚙️ API Used

**Endpoint:** `/coins/markets`  
**Docs:** [CoinGecko API Reference](https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-markets)  

This endpoint allows querying all supported coins with:
- Current price  
- Market cap  
- Volume  
- Market-related data  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React + Vite  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Fetch API  
- [CoinGecko Demo API](https://docs.coingecko.com/)
